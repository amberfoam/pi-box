# pi-box
Plans for laser cut box for Raspberry Pi + screen

Used for midimutant: https://fo.am/midimutant/

Designed to fit 7 inch touchscreen: https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/

One version is designed so the screen sits on top with no additional fastening needed - the Pi itself is then enclosed within the box. The other version is designed so the screen fits is just underneath the top piece making a neater finish but this requires the screen to be secured to the top piece - again the Pi itself is enclosed within the box.

Can be used for installations etc.
